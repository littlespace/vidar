// Package bind contains some of the types that the commander
// package uses to identify types to bind to user input or other
// events.  It is kept in a separate package so that functions
// and methods can use these types in their signature without
// importing the commander package.  The intent is to allow
// plugins to continue to work without the need to rebuild them
// every time the commander package changes.

// For more information, see vidar's plugin package documentation.

	// may continue to execute without the Bindable.
