// Package plugin contains logic for registering and binding plugins
// with vidar.  While designing plugins, we noticed that any change
// to the functionality in a common import between vidar and the
// plugin would cause the plugin to fail to load.
//
// As a result, you'll see several very small sub-packages containing
// only interface types that are used either as parameters or return
// types for methods.  This allows plugins to import those small
// sub-packages, which change far less frequently than the main
// packages.
//
// When you see one of these small sub-packages, consider them
// packages that plugins should feel comfortable importing with a
// very low risk of needing to be rebuilt for new versions of vidar.
//
// A plugin must export a single function, named Bindables, which
// returns all bind.Bindables that the plugin provides.  It must
// accept arguments of type command.Commander, gxui.Driver, and
// gxui.Theme, and its return type must be []bind.Bindable.
